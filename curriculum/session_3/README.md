Session 3
=========

Preparation
-----------

Try the [homework from session 2](https://github.com/cproctor/summer_course/tree/master/curriculum/session_2) and come to class with questions. You don't have to complete everything--stop if you get stuck!

Today's plan
------------

0. Questions about our coding

1. We are going to spend most of today working on card.py together. 

Homework
--------

See if you can complete card.py so that it passes all the tests in 
test\_card.py. If you get stuck, send Chris an email or stop and 
bring your questions to our next meeting. 

If you finish and want another challenge, try starting on deck.py. 
Read deck\_specification.py to see how a deck is supposed to work. 
You can use test\_deck.py to test your code.
