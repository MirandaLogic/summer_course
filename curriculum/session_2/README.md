Session 2
=========

Preparation
-----------

Please try the [homework from session 1](https://github.com/cproctor/summer_course/tree/master/curriculum/session_1) and come to our meeting ready to share anything you've created (crazy tea kettles and forests!) I'm also looking forward to discussing any questions or places you got stuck--it would be especially good if you were able to show us some code that's not working, or that raised a question in your mind. No matter what you've been able to do, don't worry! It will be fine. 

It would be great if you could bring a laptop computer with you; I have extra if you'd like to borrow one.

Today's plan
------------

0. Share our work
    - We will start by sharing the code we have written for tea kettles and forests
    - Discuss your questions
    - Designing a duck

1. Back to Git
    - We will commit our work into our git repositories.

2. Practice with Python dicts
    - when to use a dict
    - aside: JSON, and saving data in files

3. A few magic methods
    - \_\_init\_\_
    - \_\_str\_\_
    - \_\_repr\_\_
    - \_\_cmp\_\_

4. Start designing a card game

Homework
--------

0. Look at `code/python\_practice/dict\_practice.py. Open up Python in 
   Terminal and type all these commands so that you get some practice 
   with using dicts.

1. Write a Card class to represent a playing card. Card should pass the 
   tests in test\_card.py. You can use card.py to get started. (Make sure 
   your card.py file stays in the same folder as test\_card.py, so that 
   the tests can find the code they're testing.)

2. Try to commit your changes so that they are visible on GitHub. See if
   you can also sync your fork with this repository. 

3. Challenge: Start working on a Deck class to represent a pile of cards. Deck should
  pass the tests in test\_deck.py. You are not expected to complete Deck--
  work until you get stuck, come to Session 3 with questions.
